# Challenges and Solutions
Challenge 1: Handling Personalized Recommendations
The recommendation algorithm was initially difficult to optimize. We solved this by using user data (search history, purchase behavior) to create more refined recommendations.

Challenge 2: Secure Payment Gateway Integration
The integration with Stripe was complex but was resolved by using their official SDK, ensuring secure and reliable transactions.

Challenge 3: Performance Optimization
As product listings grew, we implemented lazy loading and pagination for better performance.

# Conclusion 
ShopEZ successfully meets the needs of busy users like Sarah by providing an intuitive, personalized, and efficient shopping experience. By utilizing the MERN stack, we have created a platform that is both scalable and easy to maintain.
